# Minecraft Physics
A simple Spigot plugin I made to demonstrate my understanding of Java and calculus. This uses the XChart library to display a player's Y-position, vertical velocity, and vertical acceleration in real time, accurate to 1/20th of a second.

A fun fact that I discovered while playing around with this is that Minecraft players have a terminal velocity of -78.4 m/s when freefalling. Using a firework rocket whilst gliding with an elytra at terminal velocity will actually give you negative acceleration because the game mechanic sets your velocity to a fixed value that is lower than that of the terminal velocity.
